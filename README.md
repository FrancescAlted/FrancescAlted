## Hi there üëã

**FrancescAlted/FrancescAlted** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a curious person who studied Physics and Math when I was young. Through the years, I developed a passion for handling large datasets and using compression to enable their analysis using regular hardware that is accessible to everyone.

I am leading the [Blosc Development Team](https://blosc.org), and currently interested in determining, ahead of time, which [combinations of codecs and filters can provide a personalized compression experience](https://btune.blosc.org). This way, users can choose whether they prefer a higher compression ratio, faster compression speed, or a balance between both.

You can know more on what I am working on by reading my [latest blogs](https://www.blosc.org/authors/francesc-alted).

## Experience

  - [Blosc Development Team](https://blosc.org): May 2014 - Today

     BDFL. Working on designing and coding libraries for efficiently compressing large datasets. Our main projects are:
     + [C-Blosc](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc)
     + [Python-Blosc](https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc)
     + [C-Blosc2](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2)
     + [Python-Blosc2](https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc2)
     
     In particular, C-Blosc2 and Python-Blosc2 implement very powerful yet flexible multidimensional containers for large datasets ([NDim and NDArray](https://www.blosc.org/posts/blosc2-ndim-intro)).

  - [ironArray SL](https://ironarray.io): October 2021 - Today
